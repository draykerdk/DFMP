# DFM
DFM is the paradigm to which projects and motions for resolutions of Drayker are built.

# DFM Protocol -

Modeling, structure functions, distribution and construct. 

The distributed function modularization / modeling protocol is the basis of structured collaboration in Drayker, with different interpretations for different types of projects.

- Simplicity and Cleanliness
- Automation
- Relation and Documentation
- Agile development is evolutionary
- Worldwide Collaboration
- International community, local outbreaks

### The protocol should ensure that papers created from it are highly valued and reassessed.

The validation process should go hand in hand with the development process, ideas should be discussed with communities and councils, transformed into a comprehensive, detailed, widely discussed and revised paper that will go through the DAOs and / or councils depending on their purpose . All ideas, goals and purposes must be in line with Drayker.

In the DFM protocol, the collaboration is based on:
- Modeling and modularization of an issue to be solved, defining the initial strategy in a Bayesian model.
- Partitioning and fragmentation of the problem, forming small functions.
- Distribution of functions among employees, through decentralized peer review.
